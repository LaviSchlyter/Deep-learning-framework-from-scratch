# Deep Learning Semester Project for the EPFL course 2021


In project I, we test different architectures in order to predict which of the input images contains a bigger number 


In project II, we build a framework inspired by Pytorch incuding automatic differentiation, which supports fully convolutional layers with activation functions such as ReLU, Tanh and Sigmoid. The losses implement are either MSE or BCE and parameters are optimized using Adam or GD
